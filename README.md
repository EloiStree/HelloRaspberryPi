### **Are You New to Raspberry Pi 5 and Computers in General?**

Don’t buy the Pi Dev Kit—just go for a regular Raspberry Pi 5 instead.

Here’s why:

- **You’ll need NVMe storage** and an NVMe reader.  
  - This means additional cost.  
- **You’ll have to choose the right one:**  
  - Risk of further unexpected costs.  
- **If you don’t buy an NVMe reader:**  
  - You’ll have to use USB storage (slower performance), or  
  - Set up the disk through a boot configuration process that can be a bit complex for beginners.  

**In short:** If you’re a beginner, stick to the classic Raspberry Pi 5. It’s simpler and more beginner-friendly.

### **Hello Raspberry Pi Dev Kit CM 5**

I purchased 4 Dev Kits to use with kids, students, and as servers when not in use.  
I thought it would be plug-and-play, but when I received the kits, I found out the SD Card slot was disabled.  

Let’s gather documentation and share where I ran into issues:

#### **The Problem: No SD Card Support**

I ran into the issue of no SD Card support right away:  

- **Error:** `Warning: SD card not detected`  
- The kit has an SD card slot, but I couldn’t find a solution to enable it.  
- There might be a way to enable it, but I haven’t figured it out yet.

#### **Workaround: Using USB and NVMe Storage**

Since SD card support is unavailable, I decided to try booting via USB and the default NVMe storage.

Here’s what I used:  
**Raspberry Pi NVMe SSD Kit**

#### **What You’ll Need**

To install from Pi Imager onto an SSD, you’ll need an NVMe reader.  
Here’s an example of what I used:

## Note to try: Student vs Server

As you can choose on what to boot first, you can put the 256 Go for using on Desktop.  
Then use USB and SD Card (if unlock) to host server when not used.  
( Saying that because my server don't use a lot's of read/write file.   )
