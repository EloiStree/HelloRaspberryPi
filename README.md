# Hello Raspberry Pi Dev Kit CM 5
  
I bought 4 Dev kit to use with kids/students and server(s) when not used.  
I through it would be plug and play but as soon as I arrived SD Card was disable.  
So let's gather documentation and share where I stuck here.

`Warning: Sd: card not detected`
There is a slot fo SD Card but I did not found a solution on how to use it.
Apparently there are maybe a solution but... No idea.

So I will try by USB and the default nvme.
